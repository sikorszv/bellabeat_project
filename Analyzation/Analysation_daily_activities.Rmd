# The business task

Bellabeat is a small company and the owners are motivated to make it to a larger player in the market, so they want to find new growth opportunities for their company. They want an analysis of device fitness data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.

The task is to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Then one Bellabeat product has to be selected to apply these insights to the presentation. Based on the insights the owners expect recommendations how they should develop their marketing strategy. The insights of the analysis has an effect on the investments in developing the products and how they want to position them on the market.

Key questions to answer with the analysis: 1. What are some trends in smart device usage? 2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? 3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

Stakeholders: - The owners: \* Urška Sršen, Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer. She’s a creative and more visual person, so for she needs a comprehensive and clear visualization. \* Sando Mur, Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team. He makes decision on precise data and well-established data analysis. - Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

# Date sources

FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (kaggle.com) This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences. [<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit>] Downloaded: Sunday, ‎March ‎10, ‎2024, ‏‎14:57:57

# Verifying the reliability of the data

The data source is reliable and original as data come from volunteer Fitbit usesrs, who allowed to track their activity. The data source is comprehensive, because it contains a lot of data about a user’s daily activity: weight, BMI, steps, intensity of activity, burned calories and sleeping. The data are from an exact time period between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 and as they are exact measured data for a given point of time, they haven’t changed since then. The data source is maintained on Kaggle monthly.

# Structure of the data

The data are organized into data tables according to day and measured type of data: activity, heartrate, steps, sleeping. There are 29 tables with user’s activity data in .csv format. Some of the data are available in wide and narrow version as well. The file format allows to process and analyze the data in spreadsheet, from data base by SQL or by programming in R. After formatting, sorting and filtering of the data I found that there are false date data and some exceling value in the data set. Data cleaning

# Cleaning the data

The following cleaning steps were executed in spreadsheets and are applied for all tables in the dataset:

1.  Merging tables from different folders with same content.
a.  create variable for the tables using read_csv()
b.  merge tables tables by rbind() function where the data are split into more tables
c.  check the number of rows with summary() and preview with head()

2.  Renaming colnames where needed
3.  Correcting dates by substituting the correct month number by using library stringr
4.  Formatting data
5.  Removing duplicates by distinct() dplyr
6.  Finding and removing missing data
7.  Checking and removing outliers
8.  Cross-hecking data validity by summary()
9.  Saving the clean data in csv by write.csv

Cleaning code and clean tables are attached to the documentation.

# Analyzing and visualizing the data


## Daily Activities 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# reading data 

dailyActivities_clean <- read.csv("~/bellabeat_project/Clean_tables/dailyActivities_clean.csv")

# explore data
##glimpse(dailyActivities_clean)
dailyActivities_clean$Id <- as.character(dailyActivities_clean$Id)
##skimr::skim(dailyActivities_clean)
number_of_ids <- n_distinct(dailyActivities_clean$Id)
print(number_of_ids)
```

There were 30 participants in the study but from the data we can see that 35 fitbits were used, which means that only a few users have more equipment in use. We can assume that the users prefer equipment that can be used more widely.

The observation took place between 03.12.2016 and 05.12.2016 and the data frame contains only quantitative data based on user entries.

### Number of daily entries

The collecting of the data took place between 3rd and 5th December 2016. Based on the data the users used the fitbit on the second day the most.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
total_daily_entries <- dailyActivities_clean %>% group_by(ActivityDate) %>%  summarize(count_by_ActivityDate = n())
kable(total_daily_entries)
chart_1 <- ggplot(total_daily_entries, aes(x = ActivityDate, y = count_by_ActivityDate)) +
  geom_col(fill="#f27059", colour="black") + labs(x='Date', y='Count of Entries')
ggsave("total_daily_entries.jpeg", plot=chart_1, path = '~/bellabeat_project/Figures')
chart_1
```

### Number of entries by Id

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


total_entries_by_id <- dailyActivities_clean %>% group_by(Id) %>% summarize(count_by_id = n()) 
sorted_total_entries_by_id <- total_entries_by_id[order(total_entries_by_id$count_by_id, decreasing = TRUE),]
sorted_total_entries_by_id %>% kable()


```

The highest number of entries was 52 and the minimum number of entries were 5 that means nobody left the device unused during the scope days. The average number of entries was 37,5 and the most user had 40 entries.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cat("Average number of entries: ", mean(total_entries_by_id$count_by_id))
cat("Median of entries: ", median(total_entries_by_id$count_by_id))
cat("Mode of entries: ", Mode(total_entries_by_id$count_by_id))
```

### Number of daily entries by Id

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
daily_entries_by_id <- dailyActivities_clean %>% group_by(Id, ActivityDate) %>%  summarize(count_by_Id = n())
kable(daily_entries_by_id)
```

### Number of usage days by Id

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
usage_days_by_id <- daily_entries_by_id %>% group_by(Id) %>%  summarize(count_activity_dates = n())
kable(usage_days_by_id)
cat("Average number of usage days: ", mean(usage_days_by_id$count_activity_dates))
cat("Median of usage days: ", median(usage_days_by_id$count_activity_dates))
cat("Mode of usage days: ", Mode(usage_days_by_id$count_activity_dates))
```

The most users used the device for 2 days, the average usage was 2,17 days.

### Distribution of users per day

On the first day only 2 users tried the device, the interest was significantly higher on the second day and the for the third day it dropped back again

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
distribution_ids_per_usage_days <- usage_days_by_id %>% group_by(count_activity_dates) %>% summarize(count_id = n())
distribution_ids_per_usage_days$percent_of_users <- percent(distribution_ids_per_usage_days$count_id / 35)
kable(distribution_ids_per_usage_days)
chart_2 <- ggplot(distribution_ids_per_usage_days, aes(count_activity_dates, count_id)) + geom_col(fill="#f27059", colour="black") + labs(x='Number of days', y='Number of devices')
ggsave("users_per_day.jpeg", plot=chart_2, path = '~/bellabeat_project/Figures')
chart_2
```

### Sums by Id

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

dailyActivities_clean %>% group_by(Id) %>%  
  summarize(count_by_id=  n(), total_steps_by_id = sum(TotalSteps), total_distance_by_id= sum(TotalDistance), total_tracker_distance_by_id = sum(TrackerDistance), total_logged_activities_distance_by_id= sum(LoggedActivitiesDistance), total_very_active_distance_by_id= sum(VeryActiveDistance), total_moderately_active_distance_by_id= sum(ModeratelyActiveDistance), total_light_active_distance_by_id = sum(LightActiveDistance), total_sedentary_active_distance_by_id = sum(SedentaryActiveDistance), total_very_active_minutes_by_id= sum(VeryActiveMinutes), total_fairly_active_minutes_by_id = sum(FairlyActiveMinutes), total_lightly_active_minutes_by_id =sum(LightlyActiveMinutes), total_sedentary_minutes_by_id = sum(SedentaryMinutes), total_calories_by_id= sum(Calories))
sums_by_id <- full_join(sums_by_id, usage_days_by_id, by='Id') 
sums_by_id %>% kable()
```

### Daily sums by Id

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
daily_sums_by_id <- 
dailyActivities_clean %>% group_by(Id, ActivityDate) %>%  
  summarize(count_by_id=  n(), counttotal_steps_by_id = sum(TotalSteps), total_distance_by_id= sum(TotalDistance), total_tracker_distance_by_id = sum(TrackerDistance), total_logged_activities_distance_by_id= sum(LoggedActivitiesDistance), total_very_active_distance_by_id= sum(VeryActiveDistance), total_moderately_active_distance_by_id= sum(ModeratelyActiveDistance), total_light_active_distance_by_id = sum(LightActiveDistance), total_sedentary_active_distance_by_id = sum(SedentaryActiveDistance), total_very_active_minutes_by_id= sum(VeryActiveMinutes), total_fairly_active_minutes_by_id = sum(FairlyActiveMinutes), total_lightly_active_minutes_by_id =sum(LightlyActiveMinutes), total_sedentary_minutes_by_id = sum(SedentaryMinutes), total_calories_by_id= sum(Calories))
  
daily_sums_by_id %>% kable()

```

### Correlation between number of entries and usage days

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

chart_3 <- ggplot(sums_by_id, aes(x = count_activity_dates, y = count_by_id)) +
  geom_point(color = rgb(242, 92, 84, maxColorValue = 255, alpha = 90), size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(
    round(min(sums_by_id$count_activity_dates)),
    round(max(sums_by_id$count_activity_dates)),
    by = 1
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of usage days vs. Number of entries",
    x = "Number of usage days",

ggsave("entries_vs_days.jpeg", plot=chart_3, path = '~/bellabeat_project/Figures')

cor(sums_by_id$count_by_id, sums_by_id$count_activity_dates)
```

There is a strong correlation between how many days someone used the device and how many entries were made.

### Correlation between number of entries and total steps

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}



chart_4 <- ggplot(sums_by_id, aes(x = count_by_id, y = total_steps_by_id)) +

cor(sums_by_id$total_steps_by_id, sums_by_id$count_by_id)
```

### Correlation between number of entries and distances

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

chart_5 <- ggplot(sums_by_id, aes(x = count_by_id, y = total_distance_by_id)) +
  geom_point(color = rgb(242, 92, 84, maxColorValue = 255, alpha = 90), size = 3) +

chart_6 <- ggplot(sums_by_id, aes(x = count_by_id, y = total_distance_by_id)) +
  geom_point(color = rgb(242, 92, 84, maxColorValue = 255, alpha = 90), size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of entries vs. Very active distance",
    x = "Number of entries",
    y = "Very active distance"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),

  )

chart_6

ggsave("entries_vs_active_distance.jpeg", plot=chart_6, path = '~/bellabeat_project/Figures')


cor(sums_by_id$total_very_active_distance_by_id, sums_by_id$count_by_id)
```

### Correlation between number of entries and calories

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

chart_7 <- ggplot(sums_by_id, aes(x = count_by_id, y = total_calories_by_id)) +
  geom_point(color = rgb(242, 92, 84, maxColorValue = 255, alpha = 90), size = 3) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of entries vs. Calories",
    x = "Number of entries",
    y = "Calories"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, angle = 0, vjust = 0.5),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10)
  )

chart_7
ggsave("entries_vs_calories.jpeg", plot=chart_7, path = '~/bellabeat_project/Figures')

cor(sums_by_id$total_calories_by_id, sums_by_id$count_by_id)
```

The positive correlation values indicate that higher number of entries result in higher total steps, distance and burned calories.

### Correlation matrix between number of entries, distancies, activness and calories

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
correlation_matrix <- cor(sums_by_id[,unlist(lapply(sums_by_id, is.numeric))])

##chart_8 <- corrplot(correlation_matrix, type = "lower", 
         ##tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45, col=colorRampPalette(c("white","pink", "red"))(10))

chart_8 <- ggcorrplot(correlation_matrix, 
           method = "circle",
           type = "lower", 
           colors = c("#76e1fa", "#fdd2c8", "#c8725e"))

chart_8

ggsave("activity_correlation_matrix.jpeg", plot=chart_8, path = '~/bellabeat_project/Figures')
```

This figure shows the strength of correlation between the variables, so we can see that there is a strong correlation between the number of entries and performance, as well as between the performance and the calories.

## Analyzing calories

### Calorie data 

Daily calories 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

### Daily calory entries

In daily calories and wide minute calories data frame there are only two days, while hourly calories and minute calories narrow data frame contain data for all three days, so daily entries are derived from those tables and analyzation is conducted based on them.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

Heart rate is how many times our heart beats in 60 seconds. This number can go up or down as we go through your day and it is in correlation with our activity. From the 35 fitbits only 15 equipment registered the heartrate. We can assume that only their fitbit were able to measure and register the heartrate in every 5 seconds.

## Analyzing METs

A MET is a ratio of our working metabolic rate relative to the resting metabolic rate. Metabolic rate is the rate of energy expended per unit of time. It’s one way to describe the intensity of an exercise or activity.

One MET is the energy we spend sitting at rest — resting or basal metabolic rate. So, an activity with a MET value of 4 means we are exerting four times the energy than we would if you were sitting still.

# Summarizing the analysation and answering the business questions

## The trends in the smart device usage

Based on the provided data, we can identify several trends and insights related to smart device usage. 
Here's a breakdown of key trends:

### User Participation and Overall Usage
The analyzation shows that user participation was variable over the observed period, with a significant spike on Day 2. The number of users directly correlates with the number of entries (as seen in the higher number of entries on Day 2).

Entries per device ranged from 5 to 52, with an average of 37 entries, median of 40, and mode of 43. Devices with higher entries likely correspond to more active users or more frequent tracking of activities, suggesting some devices were used more intensively than others.This points to a divergence in device usage, with some devices seeing minimal usage while others were used extensively.

### Activity Correlations

A strong correlation (0.7268) was observed between calories burned and the number of entries, suggesting that devices that track calories tend to generate more entries. The high correlation between calories and entries points to an increase in activity and tracking as users engage more intensively with their devices, particularly on Day 2.

Activity measures (steps, calories, METs, etc.) were significantly higher between 7 AM and 7 PM, with a peak in the late afternoon and early evening. This suggests that activity levels are generally higher during the day, particularly in the hours after work or school, which may align with typical daily routines and peak physical activity times. The intensity of activity, as measured by metrics like steps and METs, seems to follow a clear daily rhythm, which is a common pattern for wearable fitness devices.

There are strong correlations between calories, steps, intensity, heart rate, and METs, indicating that users who are more active and engaged with their devices are likely to show higher readings in all of these metrics. The moderate correlation with steps (0.268) and intensity (0.298) suggests that these metrics are interconnected but are also influenced by other factors such as user behavior and type of activity being tracked.

Total calories and average intensities have a relatively stronger correlation with entries (0.23 and 0.30, respectively) compared to other factors such as total steps or average METs.
Activity days and entries show a very low correlation (0.0258), which suggests that simply having a device doesn't necessarily lead to more usage or more data entries. It's likely that user engagement, rather than device ownership, is a stronger driver of entries.

### Device Functionality and Performance 

Devices with additional features (such as weight log and heart rate monitoring) tend to have more active tracking:
13 devices had the weight log function, of which 10 were manual and 3 were not.
15 devices had heart rate monitoring.
8 devices had both heart rate monitoring and weight log capabilities.
This suggests that users with more advanced devices (those with weight tracking or heart rate functionality) might be more engaged and record more entries, as these features likely appeal to users who are more invested in tracking detailed health metrics.


In summary, trends indicate that user participation, device features, and time-of-day activity all play key roles in shaping how users interact with their smart devices, and more active users tend to contribute more data, particularly around calories and activity metrics.

## How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

### Opportunity: User Participation Drives Engagement and Data Collection
Trend:
There was a significant increase in entries when the number of users increased, particularly on Day 2 when 25 users contributed to a high number of entries.

Implication for Bellabeat: 
Bellabeat should encourage users to engage with their devices regularly to increase data collection. This could be through targeted notifications, reminders, or gamified features that prompt users to log activities, track steps, and monitor other metrics. Higher user participation directly leads to more data and more insights for both the user and the company.

Strategy:
Bellabeat could introduce features like daily or weekly challenges to encourage users to check in and engage with the device more frequently, leading to higher data logs and insights.

### Opportunity: Advanced Features Increase Device Usage
Trend:
Devices with additional features, such as heart rate monitoring and weight logs, had higher engagement and more frequent entries.

Implication for Bellabeat: 
Bellabeat's devices, such as the Bellabeat Ivy, have built-in features like tracking menstrual cycles, activity, and sleep. The inclusion of additional health metrics like heart rate and stress levels could increase engagement, as users are more likely to track their progress and see value in their device when it monitors multiple aspects of their well-being.

Strategy:
Bellabeat could emphasize multi-dimensional health tracking (e.g., incorporating heart rate tracking or advanced sleep analytics) to cater to users who seek comprehensive wellness data. Adding more in-depth analytics or personalized insights based on these features could appeal to Bellabeat’s target demographic, driving further engagement and use.

### Opportunity: Peak Activity Times Could Inform Product Features and Engagement
Trend: 
Activity intensity (e.g., steps, calories, and METs) was highest between 7 AM and 7 PM, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening.

Implication for Bellabeat: 
Understanding that customers are more active during certain times of the day can help Bellabeat optimize its notifications and reminders. This insight also suggests that Bellabeat could design features that encourage users to track their activity during these peak times (e.g., encouraging users to log their exercise, track steps, or engage with the app after work or in the evening).

Strategy:
Bellabeat could implement activity reminders or notifications timed to when users are most likely to be active, such as reminders to log their steps or engage in short mindfulness exercises after a busy workday.


### Correlation Between Activity Metrics (Steps, Intensity, and Calories)
Trend:
Strong correlations were found between steps, intensity, heart rate, and calories burned.

Implication for Bellabeat: 
Since Bellabeat’s customers are often focused on holistic wellness, these metrics could be bundled to create a more integrated user experience. By correlating these activity metrics, Bellabeat could provide users with personalized feedback on how their activity levels (e.g., steps or intensity) are impacting their overall well-being, especially in terms of calorie expenditure.

Strategy: 
Bellabeat could build a more seamless and informative experience that highlights how users' activity levels impact their calorie burn and overall health. This could include tailored recommendations, such as increasing activity intensity or modifying daily habits to optimize fitness and well-being.

### Opportunity: Encouraging Comprehensive Health Tracking
Trend: 
Devices with weight logs or heart rate monitoring had more entries and were likely used more frequently.

Implication for Bellabeat:
Bellabeat could consider expanding its product line to include features like heart rate tracking or weight monitoring, which are common in fitness-oriented wearables but still underrepresented in some wellness-focused devices. Offering these features could increase the overall engagement of users who are more fitness-focused or goal-driven.

Strategy:
Bellabeat might consider adding heart rate tracking or weight logging to some of its devices or even releasing an upgraded version that includes these features. Doing so could help capture a larger segment of users who are seeking more detailed and actionable health insights, especially in a fitness or wellness context.

## Suggestions for marketing strategy 

### Building Community 

Bellabeat can create marketing campaigns that highlight the sense of community around their devices. For example, promoting user challenges (e.g., step challenges, mindfulness challenges) could encourage more users to participate and track their activity, creating a sense of shared experience.

### Promote Advanced Features to Boost Engagement

Bellabeat should emphasize the advanced tracking features in their marketing, particularly those related to heart rate monitoring, weight tracking, and comprehensive wellness tracking. Potential customers who are more serious about fitness or holistic health would be attracted to these features.

### Take adventage in timing of promotions and place 

Bellabeat can capitalize on peak activity times with flash sales, limited-time promotions, or content targeted at users when they are most likely to be active and engaged (e.g., early evening when activity levels peak).
Bellabeat could partner with fitness influencers or wellness coaches to show how the device helps track calories and overall activity levels.
